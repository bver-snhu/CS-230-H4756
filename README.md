  The client, The Gaming Room requested that we create a software design template for a version of their game Draw It or Lose It that would be compatible with multiple operating    systems. Currently, the game is available only as an Android application, but they'd like this converted to be a web-based application to reach a greater audience of players.The game calls for a picture to be rendered over the course of 30 seconds. Teams have that time to guess what the picture might be. If unsuccesful, the opposing team is given 15 seconds to make a guess. The game lasts for four rounds.
  One thing I thought I did well was identifying an efficient means of distributing the game. By utilizing cloud technologies like Amazon Web Services, administrators will have an easier time scaling the game as it grows, protecting it from downtime from outages, and saving costs by dynamic resource utilization (ie only paying for resources used such as memory or storage). I felt that having a UML document to use while developing the code was incredibly valuable. It provided a structure to follow when building various classes and what functions they performed. I think this allows for faster and more efficient development. As for the document itself, I think I could have done a better job discussing the differences between the server operating systems. The information I provided was very high level, and I think I could have better tailored the differences and similarties to the needs of the game itself, such as how one would utilize each for a web server or the limitations of such a need. I also think my presentation of each section was a bit too formal, which was something we were told to avoid if possible. It was said that this was not supposed to be an essay, but I naturally treated it as such.
    Interpreting the user's needs for this project was difficult for me. The requirements given were very broad, and didn't discuss things like budget, projected growth, ect. Therefore I designed the application in a way that I read was typical of most web apps. That's to say, make it usable on the most popular web clients, place it in a cloud environment so that it's easier to scale and adjust for resource needs, and use a technology stack that's easy to implement and requires less development specialization. This is why I recommended that app be built using MEAN. Had this been a real world scenario, I would have wanted to sit with the client to ask for additional details and feedback. I also would have wanted to take the original app into consideration so that the web version was as similar as possible since it seemed it was already gaining traction in use.
    As for how I approach designing software, I've never had a formal process before. Before this class, I would imagine what I wanted my application to do, draw a rough idea of what I wanted it to look like, and build it through trial and error. I've never given thought to scaling the app for expansion, and the process itself was very inefficient. The software design document gives us a much better way to envision how an application is supposed to work, what snags we might hit in development, and a way to somewhat future-proof our design by considering what our needs might be down the road. I'll be using UML templates moving forward, as I think they give me a better understanding of how various parts of an application should interact and function with others. I'll also be sure to spend more time in the planning phase with the customer, understanding their requirements
and the reasoning behind those requirements. Perhaps there is functionality that the customer hasn't considered that would be better for their project, or they haven't fully thought out what they'll want from their app in the future. I think discovery will be very important. These are some of the takeaways I had from this class.
